# Evaluating-CHD-Risk

## In this project we present three Artificial Intelligence approaches for evaluating the risk of developing a Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) in 10 years given a person's geographical, personal, educational and medical data.

We evaluate and compate the performance of the following Artificial Intelligence approaches.
*1. First Order Logic, or Expert Rule Based Systems.
2. Bayesian Networks
3. Machine Learning (The classification models that we aim to build as part of this are a feedforward ANN and a Naive Bayes Classifier)*


This project was done as part of our  **Artifical Intelligence** Class , taken at Habib University in Fall of 2019.
