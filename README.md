# Evaluating-CHD-Risk

## In this project we present three Artificial Intelligence approaches for evaluating the risk of developing a Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) in 10 years given a person's geographical, personal, educational and medical data. </br>

We evaluate and compate the performance of the following Artificial Intelligence approaches. </br>
*1. First Order Logic, or Expert Rule Based Systems. </br>
2. Bayesian Networks </br>
3. Machine Learning (The classification models that we aim to build as part of this are a feedforward ANN and a Naive Bayes Classifier)* </br>


This project was done as part of our  **Artifical Intelligence** Class , taken at Habib University in Fall of 2019.
