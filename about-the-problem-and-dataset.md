# About CHD: 
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is usually caused by a build-up of fatty deposits (atheroma) on the walls of the arteries around the heart (coronary arteries).
The build-up of atheroma makes the arteries narrower, restricting the flow of blood to the heart muscle. This process is called atherosclerosis. 
Your **risk** of developing atherosclerosis is significantly increased if you:
- smoke 
- have high blood pressure (hypertension) 
- have a high blood cholesterol level
- don't take regular exercise
- have diabetes
- being obese or overweight 
- Other risk factors for developing atherosclerosis include:
